# Airline-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of public airline sentiment based on the 'Twitter US Airline Sentiment' dataset that is available in Kaggle. The project involves four critical stages: tweet preprocessing, sentiment labeling, feature extraction, and sentiment classification.

# Dataset:
This project uses the "Twitter US Airline Sentiment" dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset provides a collection of tweets with sentiments about different US airlines.

# Methodology
Our sentiment analysis project on English-language tweets underwent a structured approach divided into the following key phases:

## 1. Preprocessing:
* Tokenization: Break down the tweets into individual words or tokens. This step helps simplify the text and prepares it for further processing.
* Lowercasing: Converted all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity and to treat words like "Hello" and "hello" as the same.
* Stopword Removal: Remove common words (like "and", "is", and "the") that do not add significant meaning in sentiment analysis.
* Handling URLs and Usernames: Stripping off any URLs and Twitter usernames to ensure the tweets are generalized and devoid of specific references
* Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduced words to their root form. For example, "running" becomes "run". This helps in consolidating the text and treating words with similar meanings.

## 2. Labeling:
Although the dataset originally came annotated with sentiment labels, we decided to chart our path for a more comprehensive analysis. The labeling process involved:
(Elaborate on how you labeled or if you used any automated tools or manual methods.)

## 3. Feature Extraction:
Vectorization: Converted the preprocessed text into numerical data for machine learning models using methods such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization.

Feature Selection: From the vectorized data, important features that heavily impact sentiment were chosen. This streamlines the data fed into the classifier, improving efficiency and accuracy.

## 4. Classification:
Model Selection: Choose suitable classification models for sentiment analysis. For instance, logistic regression, SVM, or neural networks

Training and Testing: Split the dataset into a training set to train the model and a test set to evaluate its performance.

Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure how well the classifier performs in determining the sentiments of the tweets.
